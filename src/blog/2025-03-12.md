After more than 20 years of building web projects I felt a need to share my thoughts on this marvel of a technology. That's what this is. And it timely starts on the day of Northvolt's bankruptcy and an uncertain time for my employment. Life is full of wonders, learnings and challenges. Let's not make it more complicated than it needs to. It's time to start sharing some of what I've learnt building web sites for a vast array of use-cases. Everything from blogs, rock-paper-scissor, chats, photo galleries, dashboards, scoreboards, real-time, frameworks, plugin system, design system, data analysis and forms of all kinds.
